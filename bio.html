    <p>
        I attended High School at Exeter West-Greenwich Regional High School, were I graduated in the middle of my class.<br/>
        I took two web design classes where we used notepad to start learning html tags, but quickly forgot them when we moved to adobe dreamweaver.<br/>
        Besides web design classes I also enjoyed video production. Filming and editing short films and shows.
