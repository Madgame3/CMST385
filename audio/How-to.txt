3 Things to do for adding music

1) link your .js file in the <head> of the html page.
	Example: <script src="/audio/sound.js"></script>

2) edit the .js file I sent you, directions in the file.

3) Call the function in the page. I'm using onclick of an image file, you would use it in the onclick of your usemap. (see below)
	<img onclick="sound1()" src="/audio/small-coffee.png" />

4)Everything is case sensitive so beware of caps.
