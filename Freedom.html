        The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties about the future, ambitions for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own importance.<br>

        <p>Freedom is the ability to control your own mind, body, and spirit.<br>
